#PWM Proxy for Arduino

Simple Arduino based PWM proxy. It is used to get the PWM order received from Tx and sent it to the Raspberry through serial port. 
It allows to drive the car with the native Tx radio (better for training compared to the web controller)

This is the very basic way to do it. so basic that Arduino core is more or less dedicated to that function. 
See http://www.benripley.com/diy/arduino/three-ways-to-read-a-pwm-signal-with-arduino/ for other way.
